Hello once again to everybody! Cherry 1.0.0 has been released, and I will now talk about what has happened the past 2 weeks, and what will be happening soon.

<!--truncate-->

It has been a long two weeks, but also action-packed.
We added a ton of features, including HUD widgets, Fullbright, ToggleSprint, and more.

We also introduced an experimental feature: capes. Hopefully, we can expand on this more in the coming weeks.
In the meantime, you can test it by switching it on in settings.

Some other things that happened:

We have a logo now, thanks to [Param](https://param.me).
Huge thank you for his work on it, which has been put on the website and will be in the client somewhere in the next release.

Also, we have a working and exensible configuration system, which [Chachy](https://chachy.co.uk) kindly built for us.
Without it, we would still be in the dark ages, and we can now prioritize actual development instead of working hard on a configuration system.
At some point, it may be extracted into its own project, but that remains to be decided.

This is all I have to say for this update, other than big things are coming!

Thanks to everybody for your continued support!!

P.S. we do plan on starting to support 1.15.2, so stay tuned for that.
