Hello and welcome to Cherry! As of today, the project is in a state where it works! (For the most part)

<!--truncate-->

I started the project less than a week ago, but I think that it has a lot of potential.

In future posts, I plan to talk about insights into the development, as well as provide ways to leave your feedback!

That's all I have for now!
