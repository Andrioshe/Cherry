Here is how to install Cherry in 3 simple steps:

1. Download Fabric loader. Head [here](https://fabricmc.net/use), click Download Installer, run the installer, and install the profile for Minecraft 1.14.4.
2. Download Cherry. It isn't stable enough to provide a link here, but we will soon! You need to drop this in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. If you have any forge mods, you will need to move them somewhere else!

You can now launch your game with the Fabric loader profile, and Cherry should launch!

## Adding OptiFine

If you want OptiFine, head to https://rdil.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/cherry-libs/optifine-support/, download all the jar files in that directory, and drop them in your mods folder.
