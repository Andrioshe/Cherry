:::important Release Codenames

All Cherry releases are split into categories based on codenames, which include the following:

- Oak: Minecraft 1.14.4
- Willow: Minecraft 1.15.2

**Make sure to get the correct version!**

:::

**First**, Download Fabric loader. Head [here](https://fabricmc.net/use), click Download Installer, run the installer, and install the profile for the Minecraft version that you want (must match the Cherry Minecraft version).

**Next**, Download Cherry. Choose a version:

[*Oak* (Minecraft 1.14.4)](https://cdn.rdil.rocks/cherry-releases/oak/CherryClient-Oak-1.1.0.jar)

[*Willow* (Minecraft 1.15.2)](https://cdn.rdil.rocks/cherry-releases/willow/CherryClient-Willow-1.1.0.jar)

**Lastly**, add the downloaded Cherry jar file to your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Launch your game with the Fabric loader profile, and Cherry should launch!

## Adding OptiFine

To add OptiFine, you will need to follow these steps.

### Oak

On Oak, you just need to download the Jar files in [this folder](https://cdn.rdil.rocks/cherry-releases/oak/optifine-support/) and put them in your mods folder along with Cherry.

### Willow

OptiFine *doesn't support Minecraft 1.15.2*.

:::success Alternative Option

A good alternative is [Sodium](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric), which is proven to provide much better performance improvements than OptiFine.
